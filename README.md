## Project:
I developed this login page thinking about a football game on the web, in which the user would have to enter a username and password (previously registered), and then, when pressing the login button, he would be redirected to the homepage of this hypothetical game.
On this screen, the user also have the options "forgot password" and "sign up" available.

## Tecnologies:
<div style="display: inline_block">
<img align="center" alt="James-HTML" height="35" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/html5/html5-original.svg">
<img align="center" alt="James-CSS" height="35" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/css3/css3-original.svg">
</div>

## Other aspects:
The page was developed with special attention to the semantics applied to its HTML structure.
In addition, I made some media queries to ensure that the page will adapt responsively to different screens and devices.

## Next step:
> The next step I have planned for this page are improvements regarding accessibility, as it is very important that it can be accessed by anyone and it is our duty as devs to ensure that this happens correctly! <br><br>
> I'm also going to develop the "forgot pass" and "sign up" pages as I don't want to let these links just for aesthetic purpose.<br><br>
> I'll translate the application to english, it means, the title, headings, classes' name, etc. <br><br>
> It's missing the favicon image.
